#### Slightly bigger bio
I'm a cross between [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QCgqQdmr0M) and [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVpsZxR89Mg). I do my best to balance a compulsive work habit and unhealthy commitment to completing a task/project with family time. If [this isn't the best gift world, I don't know what is](/images/about/axel.jpg).
<br><br>

I try to stay compassionate [(I wrote it on my arm)](/images/about/arm.jpg), but it's easy to get caught up in the hustle. I also try and avoid feeling shame about the perception of not accomplishing more in my life to date, sometimes I realize how lucky I am: [This is how many people live in extreme poverty around the world](https://worldpoverty.io/). I value fairness above all else and dislike social stratification. Regardless of who you are, where you were born, what your job title is, what school you attended and how many twitter followers you have, I will attempt to treat you exactly the same. I'm committed to reverse engineering unconscious bias through repition - [so reach out to me!](https://twitter.com/djlowes)
<br><br>

I train hard and work harder. Barring injury, I am likely competing for an Ironman right now. For anyone else that geeks out on personality assessments, I'm an Enneagram 3,1,8, have a 'Driving' Social Style and am in the 90th percentile for 'Ambition', 'Learning Approach' and 'Inquisitive' on the Hogan's Personality Inventory Assessment.

#### Currently
I am co-founder and COO at [Junction](https://getjunction.io).

#### Some history
In my final year at high school, a teacher was able to get my attention for the first time in 14 years of learning. Mr Findlay was my year 12 (senior) psychology teacher. I read my text book front-to-back four times. I was hooked, cognitively overloading on... cognition. Since then, I've been fascinated with how the brain works and why we all do the things we do.
<br><br>
Of course, my career went a different way. The only thing I love more than psychology is business. I tinkered with small side hustles during high-school and university [(here's a list if you're interested)](/images/about/hustle.png), but I mostly tinkered with being a free-spirited young adult (have you heard of the [melbourne shuffle?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_shuffle)). So after completing my business degree (org behavior, consumer behavior and org theory) and before getting too serious with work, I decided to experience more of life.
<br><br>
Thailand was my first stop after college. I lived and volunteered at a children's shelter for 2 years. It profoundly changed me. As best I can, I live by the [noble eightfold path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path) (which is also tattooed on my body). After that, I visited these 72 countries.
<br><br>
When I got back home, it was go-time. I finished my Masters in Social Science whilst working full-time for Telstra Business. My goal was to get a job for the World Bank or IMF. Only I realized these large INGOs are assholes and philanthropy was the way I could truly make a difference. Since then, I've been on a mission.
<br><br>
In 2013 I started De Novo Digital and brokered commercial rights to eBrandz in Australia, both were digital agencies. I grew a team from 2 to 45, getting to >$1mil ARR within 18months. There were more exciting things to do, so I cashed out to private equity in 2016.
<br><br>
Google had asked me to facilitate training workshops to their Adwords premier partners (AEs, managers, coaches and execs) in Australia, so I consulted whilst cooking up a few different business ideas (most of which were terrible ideas).
<br><br>
Snappr was a good idea - "the Uber for photography". In 2016 I joined the founding team that took Snappr from Australia to the valley through YCombinator. I grew GMV from 0-$1mil run rate in 7 months.
<br><br>
Wanting more technical experience, I taught myself how to code and sought after the most technical job in the market whilst still working inside a revenue unit. I joined the solutions engineering team at twilio in 2018. During my time here I contribued to >$50mil realized ARR and founded the technical leadership program.
<br><br>
Back to today - I'm reshaping how people work at Junction. It turns out my year 12 psychology teacher made an impact on my career afterall. Now I get to do both brain science and business!
