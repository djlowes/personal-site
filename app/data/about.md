#### Slightly bigger bio
I'm a cross between [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QCgqQdmr0M) and [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVpsZxR89Mg). I do my best to balance a compulsive work habit and unhealthy commitment to completing a task/project with family time. If [this isn't the best gift world, I don't know what is](/images/about/axel.jpg).
<br><br>

I try to stay compassionate [(I wrote it on my arm)](/images/about/arm.jpg), but it's easy to get caught up in the hustle. I have constant shame and anxiety about not doing more in my life to date, but then I realize how lucky I am. [This is how many people live in extreme poverty around the world](https://worldpoverty.io/). I'm a very extroverted introvert and I'm an enneagram 3,1,8 (at the time of you reading this I may have forgotten what this represents).
<br><br>
#### Currently
I am co-founder and COO at [Junction](https://getjunction.io).

#### Some history
In my final year at high school, a teacher was able to get my attention for the first time in 14 years of learning. Mr Findlay was my year 12 (senior) psychology teacher. I read my text book front-to-back four times. I was hooked, cognitively overloading on... cognition. Since then, I've been fascinated with how the brain works and why we all do the things we do.
<br><br>
Of course, my career went a different way. The only thing I love more than psychology is business. I tinkered with small side hustles during high-school and university [(here's a list if you're interested)](/images/about/hustle.png), but I mostly tinkered with being a free-spirited young adult (have you heard of the [melbourne shuffle?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_shuffle)). So after completing my business degree (org behavior, consumer behavior and org theory) and before getting too serious with work, I decided to experience more of life.
<br><br>
Thailand was my first stop after college. I lived and volunteered at a children's shelter for 2 years. It profoundly changed me. As best I can, I live by the [noble eightfold path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path) (which is also tattooed on my body). After that, I visited these 72 countries.
<br><br>
When I got back home, it was go-time. I finished my Masters in Social Science whilst working full-time for Telstra Business. My goal was to get a job for the World Bank or IMF. Only I realized these large INGOs are assholes and philanthropy was the way I could truly make a difference. I've embraced capitalism ever since.
<br><br>
In 2013 I started De Novo Digital and brokered commercial rights to eBrandz in Australia, both were digital agencies. I grew a team from 2 to 45, getting to >$1mil ARR within 18months. There were more exciting things to do, so I cashed out to private equity in 2016.
<br><br>
Google had asked me to facilitate training workshops to their Adwords premier partners (AEs, managers, coaches and execs) in Australia, so I consulted whilst cooking up a few different business ideas (most of which were terrible ideas).
<br><br>
Snappr was a good idea - "the Uber for photography". In 2016 I joined the founding team that took Snappr from Australia to the valley through YCombinator. I grew GMV from 0-$1mil run rate in 7 months.
<br><br>
Wanting more technical experience, I taught myself how to code and sought after the most technical job on the market whilst still working within a revenue team. I joined the solutions engineering team at twilio in 2018. During my team here I contribued to >$50mil realized ARR and founded the technical leadership program.
<br><br>
Today, I'm reshaping how people work at Junction. It turns out my year 12 psychology teacher made an impact to my career afterall. Now I get to do both brain science and business!
