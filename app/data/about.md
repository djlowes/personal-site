#### Slightly bigger bio
I'm a cross between [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QCgqQdmr0M) and [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVpsZxR89Mg). I do my best to balance a compulsive work habit and sickening dedication to completing a project with family time. If this isn't the best gift world, I don't know what is. [image]


I try to stay compassionate (I even have it written on my arm) [image], but it's easy to get caught up in the hustle. I have constant shame and anxiety about not doing more in my life to date, but then I realize how lucky I am. [This is how many people live in extreme poverty around the world](https://worldpoverty.io/). I'm a very extroverted introvert, but not an ambivert. I'm an enneagram 3,1,8 (at the time of you reading this I probably have no idea what this means).

#### Currently
I am co-founder and COO at [Junction](https://getjunction.io).

#### Some history
In 2001, after ~14 years of school, a teacher was able to get my attention for the first time ever. Mr Finlay was my year 12 (senior) psychology teacher. I read the text-book front-to-back at least 4 times. Since then, I've been fascinated with how humans think, how the brain works and why we all do the things we do.
<br><br>
The only thing I love more than psychology is business. I tinkered with small side hustles during high-school and university [list therm here], but I mostly tinkered with being a free-spirited young adult (have you heard of the melbourne shuffle?). Ultimately this lead me to Thailand, which holds a special spot in my heart. I lived and volunteered at a children's shelter for 2 years. My biggest takeaway was that no matter where they come from, what their culture is like and how horrific their circumstances have been, kids are the same all over the world and it's inspiring how they can find the joy in things.
<br><br>
My other takeaway was the noble eightfold path, as best as I can, I try to live my life this way (I have this written body too)[link]. My favourite author Thich Nhat Hanh always does a great job of [explaining this teaching](https://tnhaudio.org/tag/noble-eightfold-path/),
<br><br>
After Thailand, I kept traveling. For a while........ [all the places I've been to]
<br><br>
When I got back home to Melbourne, Australia, it was time to get serious. I went back to school to get my Masters in Social Science. My bachelors degree was in business, majoring in organizational behavior, consumer behavior and organizational theory.
